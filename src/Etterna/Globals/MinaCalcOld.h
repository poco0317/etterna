/*	The difficulties of each hand tend to be independent from one another. This
is not absolute, as in the case of polyrhythm trilling. However the goal of the
calculator is to estimate the difficulty of a file given the physical properties
of such, and not to evalute the difficulty of reading (which is much less
quantifiable). It is both less accurate and logically incorrect to attempt to
assert a single difficulty for both hands for a given interval of time in a
file, so most of the internal calculator operations are done after splitting up
each track of the chart into their respective phalangeal parents. */
